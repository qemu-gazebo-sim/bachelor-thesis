\chapterNoPageBreak{Objective}
The current work has as a main goal the development of a simulator for software testing of embedded systems developed with STMicroelectronics microcontrollers applied to mobile robotics, being able to compare with real projects. To do this, the main tools that will be used are Gazebo and QEMU, used to do the space and data acquisition of the simulator environment and the hardware emulation, respectively.

With the use of the simulator, it is expected to be able to do code validation before the bench tests with physical devices.
