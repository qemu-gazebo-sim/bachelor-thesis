The main goal of this work is to develop a simulator for software testing of embedded systems using STMicroelectronics microcontrollers applied to mobile robotics, enabling comparisons with real projects. The primary tools used will be Gazebo for simulating the environment and data acquisition, and QEMU for hardware emulation.

Using the simulator, it is expected to enable code validation before bench testing with physical devices.
